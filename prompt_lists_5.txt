make this changes for ci.yml Trigger: Trigger the action on a push or pull request to a branch containing, develop or master in its name. Job: Create one Job (e.g., cross_build). Strategy: Use a matrix (strategy: matrix) to run the build on three operating systems: runs-on: ubuntu-latest (Linux), runs-on: windows-latest (Windows), runs-on: macos-latest (macOS), Steps: Each build must include the following steps: Code checkout (actions/checkout@v4)., CMake installation (if necessary). Run configuration and build commands. Deploy
